I'm hosting my blog, [jfeldstein.com](http://jfeldstein.com), from Heroku by building on [webjames's](https://github.com/webjames) [heroku-wordpress-svbtle](https://github.com/webjames/heroku-wordpress-svbtle) repo with some minor changes. 

No affiliation with Svbtle. Just a fan of their minimal design, and wanted to spend less than 5 minutes setting up the first version of my blog.
