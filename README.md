I'm hosting my blog, jfeldstein.com, from Heroku by building on [webjames's](https://github.com/webjames) [heroku-wordpress-svbtle](https://github.com/webjames/heroku-wordpress-svbtle) repo with some minor changes. 

I'm not a member of Svbtle, just a fan of their design and of spending less than 5 minutes setting up my blog.
